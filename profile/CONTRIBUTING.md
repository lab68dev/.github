## 🔧 Making Changes (Pull Requests)

Before you start coding, consider discussing your idea in an issue first — it helps prevent duplicated effort.

### Steps:
1. **Fork the repository.**
2. **Create a new branch** for your change:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make your changes**, following the existing code style and structure.
4. **Write clear commit messages:**

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add: short, descriptive message"
   ```
5. **Push your branch** to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
6. **Open a Pull Request** against the main branch of this repository.

### Before Submitting:

* Run all existing tests (if available).
* Update documentation and examples as needed.
* Ensure your code follows the existing formatting conventions.
* Add relevant comments and type hints if applicable.

## Code Review Process

All pull requests are reviewed by maintainers to ensure quality and consistency.
You may be asked to make changes or clarify certain parts — don’t worry, this is a normal part of collaboration!

Once approved, your PR will be merged.
If your contribution is significant, you may be credited in release notes or the project’s changelog.

---

## Coding Standards

* Keep your code **modular, readable, and documented.**
* Use consistent **naming conventions** and **indentation.**
* Avoid unnecessary dependencies.
* Use **meaningful commit messages** (imperative mood is preferred, e.g., “Add new API endpoint”).
* When in doubt, follow the style of the surrounding code.

---

## Testing

If your contribution includes code changes:

* Add or update **unit tests** for new functionality.
* Run all tests before submitting a pull request.
* Make sure your code passes **linting** and CI checks.
